all quarantined bloack an any other block related json files are stored under system chains, the db_gui doesnt handle this but i think its because its not properly interacting with the polymorphicblock.polymorphicblock.py and
all quarantine blocks and details should be fetched from the  quarantine dir in system chains and displayed int the gui, in realtime, also db_gui should be an extension of the polymorphic block and its operations arent independent such that to avoid intefering witht eh main chain
a proper intergration with the whole system needs to be achieved, this time we will just adjust to achieve harmony, i dont think there is a need to regenerate whole files, just the necessary parts needed to function
